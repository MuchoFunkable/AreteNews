## Arete News

Arete is a Greek word describing a person striving for moral virtue and excellence. Arete News is a solution to todays problem of people only reading news from their most used sources, which are heavily influenced by the surroundings of where a person has been growing up and the people that they surround themself with. It is a problem because people are not exposing themselves to opposing viewpoints and thus not being challenged in their viewpoints, which is important for a functioning human being to cultivate critical thinking and an ability to point out flaws and admit when they themself are wrong.

### How does Arete News work?

Arete News works by consolidating news from the most relevant news sources in the United States. Using Levenshtein distance, it calculates the distance (difference) between the contents of news articles. The news articles are then grouped based on their distance. Afterwards, the articles are run through a large language model like OpenAI's GPT-4, which summarizes the articles and finds differences and similarities between the articles in this specific topic.

The point of this is to expose users to highly divergent news sources, so that the users can make up their own mind about the news.

### Future of Arete News

Ideally, the future should be able to not only consolidate news from one country, but from multiple countries and be able to display them in the same language. This international inclusion gives users exposure to news from all over the world irrespective of their region.

### Disclaimers

Arete News uses NewsData.io API to consolidate the news.
